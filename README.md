Hi, here is my code for Code Foo, which is for the Front End task. 
In this project, I include the video player area and the playlist queue function. Due to time issue, I have only partially complete the video control bar, so I set it as invisible and use the browser default controls. 
This is a React app. To set it up, run:
npm install
npm start
